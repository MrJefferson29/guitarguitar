    description: `The 44-02 has an active punch that will drive your sound clearly through any mix, with best in class tonality for a versatile and refined fit for any playing situation. The 44-02 doesn’t care if your gig is at a local tavern or the local arena. It pushes 100% pure tone every night. The LH3 pickups (wound in our shop in Chicago) and onboard preamp are the same components you’ll find in our USA Series 44-94, powered by a single 9-volt battery that can be changed by removing a simple snap-on battery cover (no screws to lose!). Internal dipswitches let you select the midrange boost/cut frequency. Neck profile is the Lakland 1.6” taper for fast and smooth playing and comfort.`,

    description: `The 40th Anniversary PRS McCarty SC56 Limited Edition captures the essence of a golden era of electric guitar design while delivering the playability and reliability that today’s musicians demand. With a classic PRS single-cutaway body shape and carefully chosen specifications, the McCarty SC56 is both a tribute to tradition and a modern performer’s dream. Anchored by a maple top and mahogany back, with a 22-fret, 24.594” scale length Pattern Vintage neck, the McCarty SC56 is designed for rich, resonant tone and effortless playability. The 24.594” scale length and slightly thicker back give the McCarty SC56 a warm, woody voice and comfortable feel, while its Phase III non-locking tuners and PRS two-piece bridge anchor the guitar and promote its musical sustain. The heart of the 40th Anniversary McCarty SC56 Limited Edition lies in its pickups: a pair of PRS McCarty III pickups, meticulously designed to deliver warm, clear tone with exceptional note separation and dynamics. Controlled by a simple and elegant layout — two volume controls, two tone controls, and a 3-way toggle on the upper bout — the McCarty SC56 keeps the player focused on feel and sound. With appointments like binding on the fretboard, classic bird inlays, and a vintage-inspired nitrocellulose finish, the 40th Anniversary McCarty SC56 Limited Edition blends heritage and innovation into a timeless instrument. Whether you’re chasing pure vintage tone or seeking a reliable stage companion, the McCarty SC56 stands ready.`,
